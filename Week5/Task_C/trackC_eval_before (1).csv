,"In Richelieu, how does self-play help the agent self-evolve?","From the corpus: on training agents via reinforcement learning [Zhong et al., 2019, 2021, Wu et al., 2022]. However, it is hardly explored in LLM-based agents. For LLM-based agents, a self-play game allows the agent to accumulate more experiences for self-evolution [Liu et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024a]. As self-play continues, the",NeurIPS-2024-richelieu-self-evolving-llm-based-agents-for-ai-diplomacy-Paper-Conference,0.2,1.0,0.0075,9,53
